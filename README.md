# Emission-Calculator
 
This program is a tool for calculating the CO2 emissions of a specific vehicle based on data from fueleconomy.gov. It allows the user to input their vehicle year, make, and model, and then matches that information with data from a CSV file containing emissions information for vehicles between 1983 and 2023. The program then calculates the emissions for a given trip and provides the user with the cost to offset their carbon footprint.

# Requirements:

Java 8 or later

CSV file with vehicle emissions data from fueleconomy.gov

# How to use:

Download the repository

Compile and run the program

Input your vehicle year, make, and model (formatted: y,m,m).

Input the distance of your trip

The program will give you the CO2 emissions for that trip and the cost to offset the carbon footprint

# Note:

Make sure that the CSV file is in the same directory as the .java file and is named "vehicles.csv"

Make sure to use vehicles full specializations. For example a 2013 Range Rover Evoque would be: 2013,Land Rover,Range Rover Evoque.

The vehicle emissions data used in this program is sourced from fueleconomy.gov and is current as of the end of 2022.

The program is intended for educational and informational use only and should not be used for any official or regulatory purposes.
